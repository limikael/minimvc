Minimalistic Web Framewok.

Half my career in the making, it is Invended Here&trade; and Exactly The Way I Want It&trade;.

It may or may not be what _you_ want, but if it is, feel free to use it. In an effort mainly to untangle my crumpled thoughts I will try to explain some concepts here.

MVC
---

This is a Model-View-Controller framework. Actually, it doesn't deal with the Model part at all, so maybe it can be said to be a View-Controller framework, if such a term exists. Also, I am fond of the [unix philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) in the sense that I like software that does one thing good, and one thing only. Therefore I have kept the View and Controller parts apart, they have no dependencies at all between them and you can certanly use one without the other. Maybe I should make two separate projects? Nooo that would be going too far, it is just a couple of php files anyway.
